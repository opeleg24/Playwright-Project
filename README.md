## Playwright Project - (Python)

## About/Project Overview
This project is designed for automation testing, it's built as an infrastructure using the Python language.
The project is structured as an infrastructure using the page object design pattern and layered architecture to ensure maintainability and scalability across different clients and browsers.
## Project Overview
Supports testing for the following applications/services:
- Web applications - Client-side Testing
- API Testing - Server-side Testing

## Infrastructure Utilizes:
The testing infrastructure is built with the following components to enhance automation capabilities:
- **Page Object Design Pattern**: Used to create reusable and maintainable code by keeping the page elements separated from test scripts.
- **Project Layers**: Organized into extension workflows, test cases, and utility classes to improve code clarity.
- **Support of different client browsers**: Testing can be utilized for different client browsers applications

## Infrastructure Key Operations
Infrastructure key distinguishable operations
- **Common Operations**: A utility class that encapsulates common operations and functionalities.
- **Workflow Sections**: Separates the business logic from the testing execution, organizing the flow of processes and enhancing the clarity and maintainability of test scripts.
- **Test Cases Section**: Organizes each test to display only key factors or information about the test. Focusing on essential details to facilitate quick understanding and efficient test management.
- **Page Objects Section**: Describes how the framework interacts with, identifies, and organizes web elements, ensuring a clear separation between the test code and the web UI, which enhances test maintenance
- and reduces code duplication.
- **Verification sections**: Our testing framework utilizes standard assertions to check specific conditions and verify that the software behaves as expected. In addition to standard assertions, we integrate smart assertions, which enhance our testing capabilities by allowing multiple conditions to be evaluated before a test is considered to fail.
